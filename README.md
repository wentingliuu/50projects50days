<br>

ðŸŒŸ I designed and developed a stylish [Landing Page](https://wentingliuu.github.io/50projects50days/) for collecting these mini projects.

- RWD: different display design on mobile phone, tablet and desktop. 
- Light/Dark Theme: 2 distinguish color style for users to choose.
- Animation: scrolling down to change the title font size, hover the blocks to see project's info photo.

ðŸŒŸ Also, I take notes on [Medium](https://wentingliuu.medium.com/50projects50days-%E5%AD%B8%E7%BF%92%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98-46a81a2cede) (written in Chinese) to share what I've learnt from these projects.
